shred
=====

Simple tool to generate ground truth dataset for [unshred](https://github.com/dchaplinsky/unshred) project.

It takes bunch of scanned documents, dozen of read shreds mask and producing as many realisticly looking shreds
as you want, cut under random position and angle.

This shreds can be then used to test features detectors (think base line angle detection, lines fragment detection)
of unshred project.

Dear @xa4a and @fednep, this little is for you :)
